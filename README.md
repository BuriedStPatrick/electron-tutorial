# electron-tutorial
A collection of electron projects from a Pluralsight course

Each demo contains its own Electron prebuilt references that need to be installed with npm before the first run.
The commands must be run per demo (in the scope of a package.json-file).

### Prerequisites
* npm (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Startup instructions
Installing (compiling) a demo:
~~~~
npm install
~~~~
NB: This will install the prebuilt electron binaries locally. You can skip this if you have it installed globally already.

Running a demo:
~~~~
npm start
~~~~
NB: Alternatively, you can run `electron .` in the demo-folder - it literally does the same thing.
